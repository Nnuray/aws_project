# 🍟 AI-Powered McDonald's Menu Recommender

This project is part of a midterm assignment for the **AI-Powered Data Platform on AWS** course.  
It uses AWS cloud services to build a machine learning pipeline that recommends McDonald's menu items based on user preferences.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmausteu/mcdonalds-nutrition-facts)
- The dataset includes nutritional values such as calories, fat, carbs, protein, sodium, etc., for various menu items.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a system that helps users decide **what to eat at McDonald's** based on their dietary preferences or goals.  
For example:
- "I want something high in protein but low in calories"
- "Show me a light snack under 300 kcal"
- "I want a vegetarian meal with moderate carbs"

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- **Modeling:** AWS SageMaker is used to train a recommendation model using user input and nutritional data.
- The model returns menu suggestions matching the user’s preferences.
